# text-summarization-liputan6

# 1. Introduction
By using **Liputan6 News** dataset, developing a system for summarizing documents using text understanding method which can obtain the main idea of a news story. 

Basically the system is able to summarize text into a shorter summary but still maintains the key points, phrases and context of the text. So you get the text in a more concise and concise form.

To achieve that, we use **BERT model**.
